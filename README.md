So you’ll see two games of tetris in this repo, and that is because we both
 had gotten started on tetris games before we started collaborating. By the 
time we decided to work together Haydn had already built this repository so
 we added the one I had started as Option 2. We also copied my menu screen
 to his. So there is a complete running game in the Option2 folder you just
 have to run make and then run the program named “app”, this is our fully
 completed and running game with menu different difficulties and ask you to keep playing. I feel like we both equally contributed and gave good ideas to
 one another on this project.

Option2/app- Keys left, right, and down arrows to move it left, right and down. 
‘q’ is to quite the game while it is running. And at the play again screen.
 ‘n’=no and it will exit game and and any other key means you want to play again. 

Main folder/tetris-

Quick note to end on run the game in Option2 first ha.
